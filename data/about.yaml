text: 'At HBK, we design networks that run the world: internet, electricity, plumbing, gas – whether it’s helping to power a light bulb, light a stove, or connect a neighborhood with faster internet, we probably helped put the infrastructure in place to make it happen. Our software engineering team makes tools that help our engineers map, prototype, build, and protect new systems – all on cutting-edge web-based software that helps them map and share large amounts of information.<br/><br/>The Application Development team works as an entrepreneurial group within [HBK Engineering, LLC](http://hbkengineering.com/), a fully licensed, professional engineering design firm headquartered in downtown Chicago, IL. Our organization provides civil, environmental, structural, electrical, subsurface utility, construction support, and permitting services. By working under the umbrella of a fast-paced engineering firm, the Application Development team has the best of both worlds. We are a small, agile, innovative team with the resources afforded by a larger enterprise.'
