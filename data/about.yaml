text: 'At HBK, we build things that run the world: internet, electricity, plumbing, gas – whether it’s helping to power a light bulb, light a stove, or connect a neighborhood with faster internet, we probably helped put the infrastructure in place to make it happen. Our software engineering team makes tools that help our engineers map, prototype, and build new systems –working on cutting-edge web-based software that helps them map and share large amounts of information.'
